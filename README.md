## About Me  
-  Username checks out: I’m still in the cage.  
-  Specializes in creating bugs faster than antivirus signatures can catch them.  
-  Currently working on projects that will either:  
- teach me something useful, OR  
- explode in my face. (50/50 chance)  
- ☠️ Long-term dream: have my code featured in *The Daily WTF*.
